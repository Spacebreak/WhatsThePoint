Discord Bot that tracks points for two teams

This bot allows people on a discord to track points for two teams. 
This can be handy when playing team-based games with friends on Discord.

The bot has the functionality to rename the teams to what the players want along with resetting the points and displaying the points to the discord.
The bot can also enable a secret scoremode where the scores will remain hidden for extra suspense.
